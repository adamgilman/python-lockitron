			ATTN Lockitron: I want to set the id of my call to something other than 'dash'
							as I know it's rude to 100% emulate the iPhone app but, unfortunately
							requests to the login API return blank content (but, valid cookie?)
							which breaks the API as I can't get the list of locks and UUIDs. I would
							prefer to make the call with my own ID to be polite but, can't :-(
